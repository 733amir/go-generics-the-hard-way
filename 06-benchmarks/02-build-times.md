# Build times

The Go compiler essentially transforms every instance of a generic into a defined, named type, and that additional work _must_ impact build times, right?

* [**The example**](#the-example): an exemplar case

* [**Key takeaways**](#key-takeaways): what it all means


## The example

This page describes how to run `BenchmarkGoBuild`, a Go-based benchmark that benchmarks how long it takes to build:

* a package archive
* a binary executable

Each build varies based on the:

* list type, ex. boxed, generic, typed
* number of distinct type definitions

The packages used by this benchmark are:

* **`./lists/boxed`**: defines `type List []interface{}`
* **`./lists/typed`**: defines zero to many list types based on build tags
* **`./lists/generic`**: defines `type List[T any] []T`

The `typed` and `generic` packages are also subject to the following build tags:

* **`int`**: activates that package's list of `int`
* **`int8`**: activates that package's list of `int8`
* **`int16`**: activates that package's list of `int16`
* **`int32`**: activates that package's list of `int32`
* **`int64`**: activates that package's list of `int64`


## The benchmark

Run the benchmark with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm go-generics-the-hard-way \
  go test -bench GoBuild -run GoBuild -count 1 -v ./06-benchmarks
```

The following table was generated by piping the above command to `hack/b2md.py -t buildtime`:

|  |  | 1 | 141 | 8565798 |

|  |  | 4 | 100 | 10006680 |
|  |  | 5 | 122 | 9795838 |


## Key takeaways

The Go compiler appears to be incredibly efficient at stencling the generic types together into concrete types as the build times for the generic lists do not demonstrate any distinguishable difference from the typed lists.
